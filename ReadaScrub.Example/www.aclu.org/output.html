  <p>There is strong circumstantial evidence that "Post 9/11 Blacklisting" of U.S. citizens is still alive and well. Maybe the most dangerous blacklisting tactic is "Employment Tampering". It basically means if you were blacklisted after 9/11, you may not be allowed to work in certain occupations. The Government essentially decides where you are allowed work, without an official hearing by judge - blacklistees are never informed of their 2nd Class status as Americans - not entitled to the same rights as other Americans.</p>
  <p>"Employment Tampering" by government officials/contractors - which violates Title 18 US Code 242 - is one of the hardest blacklisting tactics for federal prosecutors to police. We may even need a new federal watchdog agency to properly police this felony crime by officials.</p>
  <p>Maybe the most famous case, was exposed by a federal appeals court that severely reprimanded former Attorney General John Ashcroft (although he was never criminally indicted). Ashcroft grossly and fraudulently exploited the federal "Material Witness Statute" to be used as a quasi form of imprisonment and involntary servitude. The 13th Amendment makes this practice totally illegal without an official and overt constitutional due process.</p>
  <p>This tactic has a long history in authoritarian regimes. It was originally called "Zersetzung" and was first used in 1940's Germany during World War Two to silence dissent. During the Cold War, this tactic was adopted by then Communist East Germany. The FBI started using it in the 1950's commonly called Cointelpro tactics. Ashcroft then exploited the Material Witness Statute to be used as a Zersetzung tactic. Employment Tampering was probably the most potent tactic.</p>
