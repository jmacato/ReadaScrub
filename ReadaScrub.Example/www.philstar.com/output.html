  <p>MANILA, Philippines – President Duterte prefers a federal-parliamentary form of government, his chief congressional ally Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said yesterday.</p>
  <p>“He has expressed the view that it would be best that we have a federal-parliamentary system with a prime minister but with a president directly elected by the people,” Alvarez said in a television interview.</p>
  <p>He said members of parliament would elect from among themselves the prime minister.</p>
  <p>“The President will be in charge of national defense, foreign affairs, maybe the national police and monetary policies. The prime minister will be like the chief operating officer of a company. It’s a question of delineating their powers,” he added.</p>
  <p>Alvarez pointed out that it would not be good if the nation would have only a prime minister, since “he may be ousted anytime by a vote of no-confidence by the parliament.”</p>
  <p>“So if you have a president directly elected by the people, someone still holds power,” he stressed.</p>
  <p>He said there are various federal-parliamentary models that lawmakers sitting as a constituent assembly (con-ass) could study.</p>
  <p>“We have certain models that we can consider, like Germany, France and a little from the United States. The beauty of federalism is that you can tailor your system to what will be most applicable to your culture,” he said.</p>
  <p>There are at least five resolutions introduced in the House of Representatives calling for Charter change (Cha-cha) to shift the nation to the federal system.</p>
  <p>However, the authors differ on the Cha-cha mode and on the type of federal setup that would replace the present presidential form of government.</p>
